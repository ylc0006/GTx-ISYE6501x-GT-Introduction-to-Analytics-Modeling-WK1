The iris data set contains 150 data points, each with four predictor variables and one categorical
response. The predictors are the width and length of the sepal and petal of flowers and the response is
the type of flower. The data is available from the R library datasets and can be accessed with iris once
the library is loaded. It is also available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ). The response values are only given to see how well a
specific method performed and should not be used to build the model.

Use the R function kmeans to cluster the points as well as possible. Report the best combination of
predictors, your suggested value of k, and how well your best clustering predicts flower type.
